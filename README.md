# Rates Scrape

Simple script to scrape LIBOR, EURIBOR, SOFR rates from the web, and obtain opening bell statistics. Latter half of code is dedicated to automatic news search of a list of keywords from Google News and generating a report for manual purview. Script is built with Selenium webscraping, and may require updating in case article xpaths are subject to change.
